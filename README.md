# Tetris Clone

This project used provided backend code, and used it to create a user interface for a Tetris clone. It features a score algorithm, ability to pause the game, start a new game, adjust the size of the GUI, remap controls, change themes mid game, set difficulty and more. 

## My Code
* [ScoreAlgorithm](ScoreAlgorithm.java) - A class used to keep score in the game based off current level, pieces removed, etc.
* [TetrisAction](TetrisAction.java) - Action listener / Change Listener for all of the different commands/controls etc.
* [View Package](https://github.com/tannerdanger/tetris_clone/tree/master/src/view) - All components in this class make up different components within the tetris GUI

## Provided code
* [Model Package](https://github.com/tannerdanger/tetris_clone/tree/master/src/model) - All classes in this package makeup the provided backend
